# SQL Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project was to act as a junior data analyst and query a large sales database to answer specific business questions for a marketing team's new health and safety campaign. This project demonstrates proficiency in fundamental SQL commands for data retrieval, filtering, sorting, and aggregation.

## Tools Used
* **SQL** (MySQL dialect)

## Skills Demonstrated
* Data Retrieval: `SELECT...FROM`
* Filtering: `WHERE`
* Sorting: `ORDER BY`
* Limiting Results: `LIMIT`
* Data Aggregation: `GROUP BY`
* Aggregate Functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`

## Analysis & Queries
I wrote a series of SQL queries to extract key insights from the sales data:

1.  **Top Products:** Identified the top 5 most profitable helmet products to feature in the campaign. This helps the marketing team focus their budget on the most impactful products.
2.  **Geographic Performance:** Determined which country generates the most revenue from hydration packs, allowing for geographically targeted ads.
3.  **Customer Demographics:** Calculated the average age of customers for 'Bottles and Cages' to help build a more accurate customer profile for the campaign.

The full script containing all queries can be found in the `marketing_queries.sql` file.
